The app reads scans a QR Code and compares the resultant key with a key already present in the firebase database. If such a key does exist, the user is authenticated and the app alerts the same.

The app is a  part of our internship project. Related project is [Events-Handler](https://github.com/Aurum1611/Events-Handler) which registers users i.e. adds users to the database.
